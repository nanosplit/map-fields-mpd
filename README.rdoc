Original by Andrew Timberlake:

== DESCRIPTION:

A Rails gem which provides a hook to preview and map the fields of an uploaded CSV file to a pre-defined schema

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Captures the post and provides an intermediate view where a user can map their data to the expected schema
* Provides a default mapping view that can be customised
* Allows the import to be part of a larger form (The form fields are remembered through the mapping)
* Can only handle a single uploaded file at a time

== INSTALLATION:

gem install map_fields

== EXAMPLE:

===TestController
  class TestController < AppliactionController

    def new
      @list = List.new
    end

    def create
      map_fields :get_fields, params[:file] do
        @list = List.create(params[:list])
        @mapping.rows.each do |row|
          @list.contact.create(:title => row[:title], 
                               :first_name => row[:first_name], 
                               :last_name => row[:last_name])
        end
        flash[:notice] = 'Contact list created'
        redirect_to :action => :index
      end
    rescue MapFields::MissingFileError
      flash[:error] = 'Please upload a file'
      redirect_to :action => :new
    end

    private
    def get_fields
      ['Title', 'First name', 'Last name']
    end	
  end
